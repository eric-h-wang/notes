# Economic Indicators
## The Primacy of GDP
* Essential Economic Indicators
  * Economic Growth
    * GDP = C + I + G + (X-M)
    * ECST
  * Inflation
  * Unemployment
    * Non-Farm Payroll
  * Business Confidence
    * PMI(> 50 optimism, < 50 pessimism)(leading indicator)
  * Housing
    * Housing Starts
* Summary
  * real GDP growth is the main gauge of economic health
  * economic growth is cyclical, with a series of booms and busts
  * investors interpret the economy through economic indicators
  * leading indicators attract the most investor interest
## Monitoring GDP
* look at the PMI (first Monday of the following month) and compare the actual value with the survey value
* look at the Non-Farm Payroll (first Friday of the following month) and compare the actual value with the survey value
* Housing Starts (around middle of the following month)
* CPI ( middle of the following month)
* repeat monthly
* GDP (end of the following month after the end of a quarter)
* Summary
  * GDP estimation by government is a time-consuming periodic activity
  * GDP arrives too late to be useful to investors
  * Instead, investors glean GDP growth through related indicators
  * the indicators that are released first attract the most attention
## Forecasting GDP
* Summary
  * analysts forecast key economic indicators

  * long-term economic estimates are foundational to financial models

  * changes in estimates illustrate economic optimism and pessimism. significant changes in estimates may herald an economic turning point

  * investors compile many indicators, rather than one, to predict turning points

# Fixed Income
## The Roots of the Bond Market
* Summary
  * fixed income is another word for the bond market, where loan agreements are bought and sold
  * the term fixed income stems from the fixed nature of bond repayments
  * the growth of governments has been the main factor giving rise to the $101T world bond market
  * investors view U.S. government bonds as the safest, most liquid financial assets in the world
  * there are millions of bonds outstanding and investors use yields to compare one bond to another
## Bond Valuation

  * credit risk
    * credit risk factors
      * debt/gdp
      * deficit/gdp
      * repayment schedule
    * credit risk indicators
      * credit ratings
      * credit default swaps
  * macroeconomics
    * short-term interest rates
    * inflation
* Summary
  * a bond yield is just the interest rate on an equivalent bank account for the duration of the bond
  * the three biggest factors driving bond yields are the creditworthiness of the borrower, inflation, and short-term interest rates
  * the bond market instills discipline in governments as declining creditworthiness makes future borrowing more expensive
  * short-term borrowing is cheaper but riskier for borrowers than long-term borrowing as it relies on the ongoing appetite of lenders
  * as repayments to bondholders are fixed, inflation will corrode the purchasing power of fixed bond repayments, sending yield up
  * as U.S. government bond yield serve as benchmarks for all investments, yields on other bonds tend to move with them
## Central Bankers and Interest Rates
* central bank mandates
  * the happy medium
  * inflation
  * deflation
* central bank decision-making
  * inflation measures
    * GDP deflator
    * CPI
    * Core personal consumer expenditure
  * the output gap
    * output gap = (actual output - potential output) / potential output
    * negative gap: deflation, positive gap: inflation
* central bank toolkit
  * short-term interest rates
  * statements
* short-term interest rate estimates
* Summary
  * most central banks have a mandate to prevent runaway inflation and deflation
  * as infaltion is corrosive to bonds, fixed-income investors watch hawkishly for any signs of inflation
  * central banks closely monitor inflation expectations and the output gap when making rate decisions
  * central banks contain inflation and deflation by directly changing interest rates or by altering interest rate expectations
  * over the past few decades, short-term interest rates have been the tool of choice to steer economies
## The Yield Curve and Why It Matters
* yield curve transmission mechanisms
  * corporate impact
  * consumer impact
  * global impact
* Summary
  * the yield curve represents the cost of borrowing for various loan lengths
  * yield curves are naturally upwardly sloping due to elevated risk of long-term lending
  * corporate bonds are priced using a spread off the government yield curve so the yield curve indirectly regulates company funding
  * consumer borrowing for big-ticket items is priced off the yield curve
  * yields of developed economies are correlated, which means that the overall movement in yields has a global impact
## Movements in the Yield Curve
* FED controls the short-term interest rate
* long-term yield drives
  * interest rate forecasts
  * long-term GDP growth estimates
  * demographics
  * demand for long-term borrowing
  * supply for long-term borrowing
  * inflation expectation (strongest)
* the yield curve as an economic indicator
  * yield curve inversion (a leading indicator of recession)
* Summary
  * the far left of the yield curve is the overnight interest rate set by the central bank
  * the far right of the yield curve is driven primarily by inflation expectations
  * while the left-hand end of the yield curve is locked, the right-hand end floats freely
  * a steep yield curve signals improving times
  * a flat yield curve signals worsening times
  * an inverted yield curve often precedes a recession
## Conclusions
* Key Takeaways
  * the bond markets keep governments accountable
  * bond yields are driven by creditworthiness, inflation, and interest rates
  * central banks guard against both inflation and deflation
  * central banks influence all borrowing costs via the yield curve
  * changes in the shape of the yield curve can presage turning points in the economy

* Summary
  * IPOs raise money and/or transfer ownership
  * companies delist when they are bought, go bust, or balk at reporting requirements
  * equity indices come in all shapes and sizes
  * index performance is calculated from the performance of index members

## The Nature of Equities

* Factors to consider when comparing returns
  * the role of dividends in equity returns
  * the nominal nature of stock and bond returns
* Summary
  * shareholders own a share of company earnings and assets
  * stocks are volatile because earnings are volatile
  * shareholder returns come from both shares going up and payments of dividends
  * the range of shareholder outcomes is asymmetrical. shares can go to zero or can multiply in value

## Equity Research

* How to estimate future company earnings
  * industry classification
  * suppliers and buyers
  * revenue projections
  * cost base
* Summary
  * analysts must know the industries in which a company operates
  * industry estimates are foundational to a company financial model
  * industry drivers help formulate earnings estimates
  * investors assess company results by comparing them to estimates

## Absolute Valuation

* 5-step absolute valuation
  * estimate long-term future cash flows
  * estimate discount rate aka WACC (weighted average cost of capital)
    * get the return of 10-yr government bonds
    * identify historical overall market return (CRP: country risk premium)
    * calculate premium
    * estimate beta for company (BETA)
    * multiply market return by beta
    * take number and add back risk-free
  * discount cash flows using the WACC
  * deduct the firm's indebtedness and add the firm's cash file to derive market cap
  * divide estimated market cap by number of shares to give estimated fair share price from the valuation
* Summary
  * absolute valuation involves the discounting of future cash flows
  * future profits in the long term are worth less than future profits in the short term
  * good financial models balance simplicity with insight
  * the concept of absolute valuation is theoretically perfect
  * the outputs from absolute valuations are usually precisely wrong

## Relative Valuation

* Metrics
  * dividend yield
  * P/E
* Application
  * self
  * peers
  * market
* Summary
  * relative valuation is the quick and easy comparison of one valuation to another
  * the risk of relative valuation is being led astray by unrealistic reference points
  * earnings and multiples are used to estimate fair share prices
  * fast growing companies warrant high multiples and vice versa
  * the state of economy is a key driver of relative valuation

## Conclusions

* Key Takeaways
  * index movements are driven by movements in member stocks
  * the volatility of earnings leads to volatility of share prices
  * uncovering industry drivers is key to estimating earnings
  * absolute valuation is in theory perfect but has practical limitations
  * relative valuation is easier but sensitive to earnings growth
